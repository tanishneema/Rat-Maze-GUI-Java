# Rat in a Maze Problem 
**With Dynamic Maze and GUI Design using JAVA Programming Language**

This repository contains the code for solving the Rat in a Maze problem with a dynamic maze and a GUI design. The problem statement involves finding a path for a rat to reach its destination in a maze using depth-first search.

The maze is represented by a grid of cells, where each cell is either blocked or unblocked. The rat can only move in unblocked cells, and it must find a path to reach its destination.

The maze is dynamic in nature, meaning that the maze can be changed at any time during the simulation, and the rat must adapt to the new maze.

The GUI design is created using JAVA programming language and allows the user to interact with the simulation by changing the maze or starting the simulation.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Running the program using Apache Application

1.  Download the code from this repository as a ZIP file.
2.  Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3.  Open Apache NetBeans application.
4.  Go to File -> Open Project and select the extracted folder.
5.  Build the project by pressing Shift + F11.
6.  Run the project by pressing F6.

The program will launch, and you can start interacting with the simulation.

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates how to solve the Rat in a Maze problem with a dynamic maze and a GUI design using depth-first search in Java programming language. Since depth-first search may not always give the shortest path, the path obtained by this algorithm may or may not be the shortest path. By following the above steps, you can download and run the program on your computer using Apache application.
